Blocky UI to Cloud Orchestrators

Goal is to create a Blocky code interface to the cloud orchestration workflow engines such as salt, chef and puppet. Each of these orchestrators have a barrier to the market as many IT Administrators are not Developers. Utilizing the Blocky project from Google, which is typically utilized in interfaces to teach children and adults how to "code", and it will generate useful code like javascript, arduino code, etc, why not adapt it in a way so that the code needed for the rules engines of these cloud orchestrators could also come from Blocky as a source.
